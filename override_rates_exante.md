Based on the given formulas and your dataset, here is how you can compute `p`, `P[S=s|D]` and `P[S=s|N]` in Python using the `pandas` library:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming `data` is your DataFrame with columns 'MOD_RAT', 'DEFAULT' and 'PD_MOD'

# Calculate P[S=s]
P_S_s = data['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)

# Calculate E[P[D|S]]
p = (data['PD_MOD'] * P_S_s[data['MOD_RAT']]).sum()

# Calculate P[S=s|D] and P[S=s|N] for each rating 's'
P_S_s_given_D = {}
P_S_s_given_N = {}

for s in P_S_s.index:
    P_D_given_S_s = data.loc[data['MOD_RAT'] == s, 'PD_MOD'].mean()
    
    P_S_s_given_D[s] = (P_D_given_S_s * P_S_s[s]) / p
    P_S_s_given_N[s] = ((1 - P_D_given_S_s) * P_S_s[s]) / (1 - p)

# Convert dictionaries to Series for convenience
P_S_s_given_D = pd.Series(P_S_s_given_D)
P_S_s_given_N = pd.Series(P_S_s_given_N)

print(f"p = {p}")
print("P[S=s|D]:")
print(P_S_s_given_D)
print("P[S=s|N]:")
print(P_S_s_given_N)
```

In this code:

- `P_S_s` is the proportion of each rating in the data (i.e., `P[S=s]`).
- `p` is the expected probability of default, computed as the sum of `P[D|S=s]` times `P[S=s]` over all ratings 's'.
- For each rating 's', `P[S=s|D]` and `P[S=s|N]` are computed using the formulas given in your question.

Please note that this code assumes that `PD_MOD` represents the conditional probability of default given the rating (i.e., `P[D|S=s]`). Make sure that this is indeed the case in your data. If it's not, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.



Based on the calculations above and the given formulas, here is how you can compute `J` and `ε(S)` in Python using the `pandas` library:

```python
# Calculate J - set of ratings for which P[S=s|D] > P[S=s|N]
J = set(P_S_s_given_D[P_S_s_given_D > P_S_s_given_N].index)

# Calculate ε(S) based on the definition of J
epsilon_S = p * P_S_s_given_D[~P_S_s_given_D.index.isin(J)].sum() \
            + (1 - p) * P_S_s_given_N[P_S_s_given_N.index.isin(J)].sum()

print(f"J = {J}")
print(f"ε(S) = {epsilon_S}")
```

In this code:

- `J` is the set of ratings for which `P[S=s|D]` is greater than `P[S=s|N]`.
- `epsilon_S` is the natural error rate, computed as the sum of `P[S=s|D]` for `s` not in `J` times `p`, plus the sum of `P[S=s|N]` for `s` in `J` times `(1 - p)`.

Please note that this code assumes that the conditional probabilities `P[S=s|D]` and `P[S=s|N]` were calculated correctly in the previous steps. Make sure to run those calculations before running this code.

Based on the context and the given formula, the Python code to calculate the Accuracy Ratio (AR) can be written as follows:

```python
AR = 1 / (p * (1 - p)) * \
    (2 * sum((1 - data['PD_MOD'][s]) * data['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)[s] *
             sum(data['PD_MOD'][t] * data['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)[t]
                 for t in range(s))
             for s in range(len(rating_to_num))) 
     + sum(data['PD_MOD'][s] * (1 - data['PD_MOD'][s]) * data['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)[s]**2
           for s in range(len(rating_to_num)))) - 1

print(f"AR = {AR}")
```

In this code:

- We calculate the Accuracy Ratio (AR) using the provided formula.
- We use a normalized value count of `MOD_RAT` to get the unconditional probability `P[S=s]` for each rating `s`.
- We use a comprehension inside the `sum()` function to iterate over the range of possible ratings `s` and `t`.

Please ensure that the previous calculations have been carried out correctly before running this code.

This code assumes that the `data` DataFrame contains the `PD_MOD` probabilities for each rating. Make sure to replace `data`, `PD_MOD`, and `MOD_RAT` with your actual DataFrame and column names. Also replace `rating_to_num` with the actual dictionary you use for mapping ratings to numbers. 

Please note, that the given code assumes a zero-based index for ratings. If your rating index starts from 1, please adjust the ranges in the for-loops accordingly.
----------------------------
Here's how you could code the procedure in Python, making use of the `scipy.optimize` module to perform the numerical solution for parameters `a` and `b`. First, we need to define the necessary functions.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm, binom
from scipy.optimize import minimize

k = 16
lambda_ = 0.55
varrho = 0.1

# Correlated binomial distribution function
def G(lambda_, varrho, y):
    return norm.cdf((norm.ppf(lambda_)-np.sqrt(varrho)*y) / np.sqrt(1-varrho))

# Inverse logit function
def inv_logit(s, a, b):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(a + b * s))

# Quasi-moment matching equations
def equations(params, PD_target, AR_target):
    a, b = params
    PD = 0
    AR = 0
    for s in range(1, 18):
        p_s = binom.cdf(s - 1, k, G(lambda_, varrho, norm.ppf(s / 17)))
        p_d_s = inv_logit(s, a, b)
        PD += p_s * p_d_s
        AR += p_s * ((1 - p_d_s) * sum(binom.cdf(t - 1, k, G(lambda_, varrho, norm.ppf(t / 17))) * inv_logit(t, a, b)
                                       for t in range(1, s))
                     + p_d_s * (1 - p_d_s) * p_s)
    AR = 1 / (PD * (1 - PD)) * (2 * AR - 1)
    return (PD - PD_target)**2 + (AR - AR_target)**2
```

In the above code, `PD_target` and `AR_target` are the predefined values of PD and AR. Then, we use the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to solve for `a` and `b`.

```python
PD_target = 0.02  # predefined PD
AR_target = 0.8  # predefined AR

initial_guess = [0, 0]
result = minimize(equations, initial_guess, args=(PD_target, AR_target), method='Nelder-Mead')
a, b = result.x
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
```

This is a very simplistic approach and may not always converge to a solution, especially for more complex systems. Adjustments might be necessary, depending on the specific use case. Moreover, for larger scales (e.g., larger `k`), this code might become slow and a more efficient computation (maybe involving some precomputation) would be necessary. Please adjust according to your needs and available computational resources.
