Sure, to calculate $J$ in Python, you would typically use a data manipulation library such as pandas. Below is an example of how you might do it, assuming that your data is stored in a pandas DataFrame named `df`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# assuming df is your DataFrame, and it has been defined and loaded with data
# MOD_RAT is the rating, and DEFAULT indicates whether default has occurred

# calculate the probabilities P[S=j|D] and P[S=j|N] for each j
prob_D = df[df['DEFAULT'] == 1]['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)
prob_N = df[df['DEFAULT'] == 0]['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)

# for each rating, check whether P[S=j|D] > P[S=j|N], and if so, include j in J
J = [j for j in df['MOD_RAT'].unique() if prob_D.get(j, 0) > prob_N.get(j, 0)]

print(J)
```

In this code:

- `df[df['DEFAULT'] == 1]['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)` calculates the relative frequencies of each rating among defaulters, which estimates the probabilities $\mathrm{P}[S=j\,|\,D]$.
- `df[df['DEFAULT'] == 0]['MOD_RAT'].value_counts(normalize=True)` does the same for non-defaulters to estimate $\mathrm{P}[S=j\,|\,N]$.
- The list comprehension `J = [j for j in df['MOD_RAT'].unique() if prob_D.get(j, 0) > prob_N.get(j, 0)]` goes through each unique rating in the data, and includes it in $J$ if $\mathrm{P}[S=j\,|\,D] > \mathrm{P}[S=j\,|\,N]$.
- The `get` method is used with a default value of 0, which is used when a rating is not present in the calculated frequencies (meaning that the corresponding probability is 0).

The result `J` is a list of ratings for which default is more likely than non-default according to the model.
