To find the Accuracy Ratio (AR) given the natural error rate $\epsilon(S)$, we can rearrange the given equation. However, keep in mind that the rearrangement might not be perfect due to the inherent complexity of the original equation. 

The original equation is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:main}
	\epsilon(S) \ = \ \Phi\left(- \,\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}\,\Phi^{-1}\Big(\frac{AR+1}2\Big)\right).
\end{equation}

After rearranging, we have:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:main_rearranged}
	AR \ = \ 2\Phi\left(\sqrt{2}\Phi^{-1}\Big(\epsilon(S)\Big)\right) - 1.
\end{equation}

Now, let's implement this formula in Python:

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np

def calculate_AR(epsilon_S):
    return 2 * norm.cdf(np.sqrt(2) * norm.ppf(epsilon_S)) - 1

epsilon_S = 0.25  # example value of the natural error rate
AR = calculate_AR(epsilon_S)

print(f"The Accuracy Ratio (AR) is {AR}")
```

This function `calculate_AR` takes the natural error rate $\epsilon(S)$ as an input and computes the associated Accuracy Ratio (AR) according to the formula derived above. You can use it with any valid value of the natural error rate to compute the corresponding AR. Please note that this inverse function has been derived under the assumption of normally distributed score variables as indicated in the original corollary.
